The\nbasic setup can be changed using the 3D Graphics View Style Bar (e.g. display of coordinate\naxes, xOy-plane, grid). In addition, the Preferences Dialog provides more options to\ncustomize the \n3D Graphics View. You may also change the layout of GeoGebra’s\nuser interface according to your needs.\n\n[#CreatingMathematicalObjects]#Creating Mathematical Objects#\n\nConstructions with the Mouse\n\nUsing the construction Tools available in the 3D\nGraphics View Toolbar you can create geometric constructions in the\n 3D Graphics\nView with the mouse. Select any construction tool from the 3D Graphics View Toolbar and read the tooltip provided in\nthe  3D\nGraphics View in order to find out how to use the selected Tool.\n\nAny object you create in the  3D Graphics View also has an algebraic representation in the\n\nAlgebra View.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\nSelect the \nSphere with Center through Point Tool and click in the 3D Graphics\nView twice. The first click creates the center point while the second click creates a sphere and a point on the sphere.\n\n Hint: In order to create a new point in the\n3-dimensional space, you need to...\n\n click and hold the mouse key (tap and hold) in order to define it's x- and y-coordinate, then\n drag the point up or down in order to change the z-coordinate and\n release the click (tap) once you reached the desired coordinates.\n\n3D Graphics View Toolbar\n\nThe 3D Graphics View Toolbar provides a wide range of Tools\nthat can be operated with the mouse and allow you to create the three-dimensional graphical representations of objects\ndirectly in the  3D Graphics View. Every icon in the Toolbar represents a\nToolbox that contains a selection of related construction Tools. In order to\nopen a Toolbox, you need to click on the corresponding default Tool shown in the 3D Graphics View Toolbar\n(GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps) or on the small arrow in the lower right corner of the Toolbar icon (GeoGebra Desktop).\n\nThe Tools of the 3D Graphics View Toolbar are organized by the nature of resulting objects or the functionality of\nthe Tools. You will find Tools that create different types of planes in the\n\nPlanes Toolbox or Tools that allow you to create geometric solids in the\n Geometric Solids\nToolbox.\n\nDirect Input using the Input Bar\n\nGeoGebra’s \n3D Graphics View supports points, vectors, lines, segments, rays, polygons, and circles in a three-dimensional\ncoordinate system. You may either use the Tools provided in the 3D\nGraphics View Toolbar, or directly enter the algebraic representation of these objects in the\nInput Bar or Input Field of the\n\nAlgebra View (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps).\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\nEnter A=(5, -2, 1) into the Input Bar or Input Field of the  Algebra View in order to create a point in the three-dimensional\ncoordinate system.\n\nFurthermore, you may now create surfaces, planes, as well as geometric solids (pyramids, prisms, spheres, cylinders, and\ncones).\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\nEnter f(x, y)=sin(xy) in order to create the corresponding surface.\n\nCommands\n\nIn addition to the wide range of /Category:Commands.adoc[Commands] available for the other Views\nof GeoGebra, there also is a selection of 3D Commands specifically for the 3D Graphics View.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\nLet A=(2, 2, 0), B=(-2, 2, 0), C=(0, -2, 0), and D=(0, 0, 3). Input the command\nPyramid[A, B, C, D] and hit the [.kcode]#Enter# key in order to create the pyramid with base ABC and apex D.\n\n[#MovingMathematicalObjectsin3D]#Moving Mathematical Objects in 3D#\n\nMove Tool\n\nUsing the  Move\nTool you may drag and drop Free Points in the\n 3D Graphics\nView. In order to move a point in the three-dimensional coordinate system, you can switch between two modes by clicking\non the point:\n\n Mode xOy-plane: You may move the point parallel to the xOy-plane without changing the z-coordinate.\n Mode z-axis: You may move the point parallel to the z-axis without changing the x- and y-coordinates.\n\nMoving Objects using Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nIn the  3D\nGraphics View, you may use the [.kcode]#Page Up# key in order to move a selected object up and the [.kcode]#Page Down#\nkey in order to move a selected object down.\n\n[#DisplayofMathematicalObjects]#Display of Mathematical Objects#\n\nTranslation of the Coordinate System\n\nYou may translate the coordinate system by using the  Move Graphics View Tool and dragging the\nbackground of the  3D Graphics View with your pointing device. Thereby, you can switch between two\nmodes by clicking on the background of the  3D Graphics View:\n\n Mode xOy-plane: You may translate the scene parallel to the xOy-plane.\n Mode z-axis: You may translate the scene parallel to the z-axis.\n\nAlternatively you can hold the [.kcode]#Shift# key and drag the background of the\n 3D Graphics\nView in order to translate the coordinate system. Again, you need to click in order to switch between the two modes\nwhile holding the [.kcode]#Shift# key.\n\nYou can go back to the default view by selecting the button\n\nBack to Default View in the 3D Graphics View Style Bar.\n\nRotation of the Coordinate System\n\nYou may rotate the coordinate system by using the  Rotate 3D\nGraphics View Tool and dragging the background of the  3D Graphics View with your pointing device.\n\nAlternatively you can right-drag the background of the  3D Graphics View in order to rotate the coordinate system.\n\nIf you want to continue the rotation of the coordinate system when the mouse is released, you may use the option\n\nStart Rotating the View and  Stop Rotating the View in the 3D Graphics View Style Bar.\n\nYou can go back to the default rotation by selecting the button\n Rotate back to default view in the 3D Graphics View Style Bar.\n\nViewpoint in front of an Object\n\nYou may use the \nView in front of Tool in order to view the coordinate system from a viewpoint in\nfront of the selected object.\n\nZoom\n\nYou may use the  Zoom In\nTool and  Zoom Out\nTool in order to zoom in the  3D Graphics View.\n\n Hint: You may also use the wheel of your mouse to zoom.\n\n3D Graphics View Style Bar\n\nThe 3D Graphics View Style Bar contains buttons to\n\n  show /\nhide the coordinate axes,  the xOy-plane, and a\n grid in the xOy-plane\n go  back to default view\n change the  Point Capturing settings\n \nstart / stop rotating the view automatically\n adjust the  view\ndirection\n  choose the type of projection\n open the  Properties\nDialog (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps)\n display additional \nViews in the GeoGebra window (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps)\n\nStyle Bar for Tools and Objects\n\nDepending on the Tool or object you select, the buttons in the Style Bar_\nadapt to your selection.

You can change this label setting in the\n Properties Dialog on tab Basic by selecting the\ncorresponding option Name, Value, or Name & Value from the drop down menu next to the checkbox Show Label.\n\nThe value of a point is its coordinates, while the value of a function is its equation.\n\nCaption\n\nHowever, sometimes you might want to give several objects the same label, for example, to label the four edges of a\nsquare a. In this case, GeoGebra offers captions for all objects, in addition to the three labeling options mentioned\nabove.

Then (a, b) ⊗ (c, d) returns the z-coordinate of vector\nproduct (a, b, 0) ⊗ (c, d, 0) as single number.\n\nSimilar syntax is valid for lists, but the result in such case is a list.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\n {1, 2} ⊗ {4, 5} returns {0, 0, -3}\n* {1, 2, 3} ⊗ {4, 5, 6} returns {3, 6, -3}."},{"title":"Predefined Functions and Operators","category":"general","path":"Predefined_Functions_and_Operators.adoc","content":"Predefined Functions and Operators\n\nTo create numbers, coordinates, or equations using the Input Bar you may also use the following\npre-defined functions and operations.

You can enter scripts in the Scripting tab of\nthe  Properties Dialog\nof the object you want to assign a script to.\n\nThe Properties panel needs to be closed for scripts to work.\n\nDifferent objects support different types of scripting; the execution of scripts can be triggered by :\n\n clicking a particular object (OnClick tab)\n updating a particular object (when value or properties of the object are changed) (OnUpdate tab)\n changing the content of an input box (OnChange tab)\n when the mouse button is released (or finger is removed from the screen for touch devices) after dragging an object\n(On Drag-end tab)\n loading the file (for JavaScript - Global Javascript tab)\n Javascript listeners (see the API reference)\n\nThe difference between OnUpdate and OnChange scripting for an input box is that in case the script is entered in the\nOnUpdate tab, it is executed only when the focus is removed from the input box (by e.g. clicking on a button, clicking\nin the Graphics View, etc...), whereas scripting entered in the OnChange tab will be executed as soon as the content\nof the input box changes, and the focus is still on the input box itself.\n\n Check this https://www.geogebra.org/m/bek5uqah demo of OnChange and OnUpdate scripts for an input box.\n Check this https://www.geogebra.org/m/kxgvyqvj demo of OnDrag-end scripting for a draggable point.\n\nGGBScript\n\nYou can create scripts consisting of GeoGebra commands, as you would use them in the Input Bar.\nAfter triggering the script, every command is executed, in the same order they are written, sequentially.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\n a is an integer-valued slider ranging from 1 to 3 (therefore Increment equals 1)\n type in: list1 = {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}\n in properties of a, set \"On Update\" script to SetColor(a, Element(list1, a))\n by moving the slider you change its color\n\nExplanation: Every time the slider is moved, there an update occurs. So, for every move the script is called and the\nvalue of a is used to get one color from the list and change the color of the slider a.\n\nYou can use # to start a comment\n\n Hint: Some commands can only be used for scripting. The\nlist of these command is available in the ScriptingCommands page.\n\nJavaScript\n\nJavaScript is a programming language used by many Internet technologies. Unlike GeoGebra Script, in Javascript commands\ndon't have to be executed as a simple sequence, but a control flow (if, while, for) can be used. For\ngeneric JavaScript you can find a nice tutorial on\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide[developer.mozilla.org]. In GeoGebra, you can use special JavaScript\nmethods which allow you to change the construction. These methods belong to ggbApplet object, which means that you call\nthem as ggbApplet.methodname(parameter,..,parameter). For complete list of these methods see\nthe API reference.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\n....\nfor(var i =0;i<10;i++) \n   ggbApplet.evalCommand(\"A\"+i+\"=(random()10,random()10)\");\n....\n\nThis script creates 10 points A~0~ to A~9~ at random coordinates.\n\nScripting with JavaScript is very versatile, but many tasks can also be achieved using the simpler GeoGebraScript.\n\nGlobal JavaScript\n\nIn the Global JavaScript part of the Scripting tab in the\n Properties Dialog you may define functions (not\nvariables) which will be available from the other scripts. You can also define function ggbOnInit(name, api), which is\ncalled automatically once the construction is loaded. The ggbOnInit function can be used for registering some\nlisteners, as shown below.\n\n[EXAMPLE]\n\n....\nfunction onAdd(name){\n    alert(\"Object \"+name+\" was added.\");\n}\n\nfunction ggbOnInit(name, api){\n    api.registerAddListener(\"onAdd\");\n}\n....\n\nFirst we defined function onAdd that given a string shows a message depending on that string. After that, using the\nggbOnInit function, we told GeoGebra to call this function whenever a new object is added. Once we reload our\nconstruction, function ggbOnInit will be called and since then, when user adds a point named e.g. A, message \"Object\nA was added\" will appear.\n\nYou can also use listeners for actions like rename, delete and clear construction. A complete list is available in\nthe API reference.\n\nUsing any ggbApplet methods in Global JavaScript_ outside of ggbOnInit will not work as intended since they will be\ncalled before the construction is loaded."},{"title":"Selecting objects","category":"general","path":"Selecting_objects.adoc","content":"Selecting objects\n\nSelecting one Object\n\nActivate the Move Tool and click\n(tap) on an object in order to select it.\n\nSelecting several Objects\n\nYou can select several objects at the same time in the following ways:\n\n Hold the [.kcode]#Ctrl#-key (Mac OS: [.kcode]#Cmd#-key) while clicking on different objects.\n Use the Move Tool in order to\ncreate a selection rectangle.\n+\n\nAll objects within the selection rectangle are selected.\n\nHow to create a selection rectangle using the mouse\n\n.
